# Course Outline

## Overview
Coding a computer is not all sitting at a keyboard typing. In this hands on workshop we will use the BBC micro:bit and our creativity to make some wearable tech sure to be the fashion forward accessory of the year. The BBC micro:bit is a tiny programmable computer packed with a display, accelerometer, compass and more. Using Microsoft MakeCode a block based development environment we will learn some basic computer science skills while having fun making some custom creations with our micro:bit computer.  

## Take Home Item
BBC micro:bit maker kit and custom creation, a multi-funciton micro:bit watch
