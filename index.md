# Course Outline

## Take Home Item
BBC micro:bit maker kit and custom creation

## Overview
Coding a computer is not all sitting at a keyboard typing. In this hands on workshop we will use the BBC micro:bit and our creativity to make some wearable tech sure to be the fashion forward accessory of the year. The BBC micro:bit is a tiny programmable computer packed with a display, accelerometer, compass and more. Using Microsoft MakeCode a block based development environment we will learn some basic computer science skills while having fun making some custom creations with our micro:bit computer.  

Each lesson will contain 3 parts:
1. Overview: here students will be eyes forward learning about a given topic
1. Activity: here students will make what they learned real with a step by step exercise
1. Project: here students will put there learnings to the test with open ended project

> NOTE: Subbing in links from the CS lesson plan, will update with student ready version of tasks
