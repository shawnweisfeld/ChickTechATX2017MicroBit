# Course Outline

Each lesson will contain 3 parts:
1. Overview: here students will be eyes forward learning about a given topic
1. Activity: here students will make what they learned real with a step by step exercise
1. Project: here students will put there learnings to the test with open ended project

> NOTE: Subbing in links from the CS lesson plan, will update with student ready version of tasks
